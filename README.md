## Hey there! 👋🏻

![Welcome!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FY1OEo-SkZOV8caMEWRnUSuJuqvW9lSC)

I'm [Beth](https://linkedin.com/in/beth-glenfield), a full stack engineer and Women Who Code Director by day, and an introverted Brazilian jujitsu player by night (pandemic aside). You can find me working on open-source projects or writing articles on [dev.to](https://dev.to/eglenfield), and I'm always available to catch up with a fellow techie, so reach out! Looking forward to hearing from you :) 🌍
